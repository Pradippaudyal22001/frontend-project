    <p>A <b>computer</b> is a <a href="">digital electronic machine</a>
        or logical operations (computation) automatically.
        Modern computers can perform generic sets of operations known as <a href=""> programs.</a>
        These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks.
        A <b>computer system</b> is a "complete" computer that includes the <a href="">hardware</a>,
        <a href="">operating system</a> (main <a href="">software</a> ), and <a href="">peripheral</a> equipment needed
        and used
        for "full" operation. This term may also refer to a group of computers that
        are linked and function together, such as a <a href="">computer network</a> or <a href="">computer cluster</a>.
    </p>

    <p>A broad range of <a href="">industrial</a> and <a href="">consumer products</a> use computers as <a
            href="">control systems</a>. Simple special-purpose
        devices like <a href="">microwave ovens</a>
        computer-aided design, as well as general-purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices like
        smartphones. Computers power the Internet, which links billions of other computers and users.</p>

    <p>Conventionally, a modern computer consists of at least one processing
        element, typically a central processing unit (CPU) in the form of a
        microprocessor, along with some type of computer memory, typically
        semiconductor memory chips. The processing element carries out arithmetic and logical
        operations, and a sequencing and control unit can change the order of operations in response to stored
        information. Peripheral devices include input devices (keyboards, mice, joystick, etc.), output devices
        (monitor screens, printers, etc.), and input/output devices that perform both functions (e.g., the 2000s-era
        touchscreen). Peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source and they enable
        the result of operations to be saved and retrieved.</p>
